## 10. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Charging Questions

**Q: How long does it take to fully charge the power bank?**
A: Using the included USB-C cable with a 20W adapter, the VOLTIX Pro 10K charges from 0% to 100% in approximately 3-4 hours. We recommend using a PD-compatible charger for the fastest charging experience.

**Q: Can I charge two devices at the same time?**
A: Yes! You can use wireless charging and wired charging simultaneously. For example, charge your phone wirelessly while charging your earbuds case via USB-A or USB-C. The power bank intelligently distributes power between connected devices.

**Q: How many times can it charge my phone?**
A: This depends on your phone's battery capacity. For a typical smartphone with a 3,000-4,000mAh battery, you can expect 2-3 full charges. For larger phones with 4,500-5,000mAh batteries, expect 1.5-2 full charges. Wireless charging is slightly less efficient than wired charging.

**Q: Can I charge the power bank while it's charging my phone?**
A: Yes, pass-through charging is supported. You can charge the power bank via USB-C input while simultaneously charging your devices.

### Compatibility Questions

**Q: Is magnetic wireless charging compatible with all phones?**
A: The magnetic attachment works best with phones that have built-in magnetic alignment (like iPhone 12 and newer with MagSafe). For other phones, you can use a magnetic case or simply place the phone on the charging surface—wireless charging will still work for any Qi-compatible device.

**Q: Will it work with my phone case?**
A: Wireless charging works through most cases up to 6mm thick. Metal cases or cases with metal plates will block wireless charging. MagSafe-compatible cases work best with the magnetic attachment.

**Q: Does it work with AirPods?**
A: Yes! AirPods Pro and AirPods with a wireless charging case can be charged on the wireless charging surface. You can also charge them via the USB ports.

### Travel Questions

**Q: Can I take this power bank on an airplane?**
A: Yes, the VOLTIX Pro 10K is airline-approved for carry-on luggage. With a 10,000mAh (37Wh) capacity, it falls well within the TSA and international aviation limits of 100Wh for lithium batteries. Please keep it in your carry-on bag, not checked luggage.

**Q: Does it work internationally?**
A: Yes, the power bank works worldwide. Just bring the appropriate wall adapter for the country you're visiting to recharge it.

### Safety Questions

**Q: Is this power bank safe? Will it overheat?**
A: Absolutely. The VOLTIX Pro 10K features multi-layer protection including overcharge protection, over-discharge protection, short circuit protection, and temperature monitoring. If the device detects overheating, it automatically reduces output to safe levels. It's CE, FCC, and RoHS certified.

**Q: Can I leave it charging overnight?**
A: Yes, the intelligent overcharge protection prevents any damage from extended charging. Once fully charged, the power bank stops drawing power.

### Purchase Questions

**Q: What warranty does the product include?**
A: The VOLTIX Pro 10K comes with an 18-month manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. Our customer support team is available via email for any issues or questions. We also offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee—if you're not happy, return it for a full refund.

**Q: Is a wall charger included?**
A: The package includes a USB-C cable but not a wall adapter. We recommend using a 20W or higher PD adapter for fastest charging (sold separately or use an existing adapter).
